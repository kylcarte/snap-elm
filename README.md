snap-elm
========

Serve Elm files from the Snap web framework.

The few functions included are documented in place.

#### Change List:

* 0.1.1
  * ElmOptions values are now more apparent at time of construction.
  * added source path to ElmOptions, so elm binary can find locally
    defined modules.
  * refined serveElmDirectory, so it handles routes to files transparently.
